[mod-setting-description]
Pollution_Absorption_Limit_Type=A Linear Limitation will ensure that you can only have enough machines active to remove a set percentage of pollution on each surface. \n\n An Exponential Limitation is an upward-trending decay, and will allow you to have enough machines to remove 100% of pollution on the map, but only up to and including a certain point. Past that point, fewer and fewer machines will be allowed relative to the total amount of pollution. \n\n A Logistic Limitation will grow in an almost exponential fashion during its first phase, then will become more similar to exponentional decay function in its second phase, but is asymptotic towards the Limit L in the settings.  \n\n A Graphing Utility such as Desmos may be useful for visualizing how changing the values will alter each function.
Max_Linear_Pollution_Absorption=Maximum Absorption via pollution-reducing machines allowed for each surface as a percentage (0-100). Only works when in 'Linear' Limitation mode
Exponential_Const_Multiplier=The Value of C in f(x) = ((C^(E-1)) * x) ^ (1/E). This functions as a value past which machines will no longer be able to remove 100% of pollution. Only works when in 'Parabolic' Limitation mode.
Exponential_Exponent=The Value of D in f(x) = ((C^(E-1) * x) ^ (1/E). This affects how quickly the function grows. Lower values for this setting will scale better with higher amounts of pollution. Only works when in 'Parabolic' Limitation mode.
Logistic_Limit=The Value of L in f(x) = L / (1 + e ^(-k / x) * (x-z)). L is an asymptote, and the function will never reach this value, nor will it go above it.
Logistic_k=The Value of k in f(x) = L / (1 + e ^(-k / x) * (x-z)) This determines how quickly the function will grow. Smaller values are recommended for a steadier growth phase.
Logistic_z=The Value of z in f(x) = L / (1 + e ^(-k / x) * (x-z))
Entities_per_Poll=Higher Values will increase the mod's responsiveness, Lower Values will improve computer performance.
